## Practice ML Project - Hotdog or not

What does the app do?
Hotdog-Or-Not is a simple iOS app that uses machine learning to classify images as either a "hotdog" or "not hotdog". It uses the CoreML framework with the Inceptionv3 model (pre trained model by appe) to process images and Vision to handle image classification tasks.

### Key features:
- Capture images in real-time using the device's camera.
- Image classification with the Inceptionv3 model.
- Immediate feedback on whether the captured image is a hotdog or not via the navigation bar title update.
